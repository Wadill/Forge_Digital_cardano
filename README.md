# What it does
The Forge_Digital_cardano project is a DAO native implementation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) in JavaScript, designed to provide robust cryptography and network utilities. It allows DAOs and decentralized networks to secure their communication channels using widely trusted cryptographic protocols like RSA, AES, SHA-256, and X.509 certificates. This tool provides a full suite of cryptographic functions, including message encryption, secure socket connections, and the ability to manage Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in decentralized environments.



# The problem it solves
In decentralized ecosystems like DAOs, there is a growing need for secure communication between nodes and users. Traditional TLS implementations are usually tailored for centralized systems and lack native support for DAO governance and consensus mechanisms. Forge_Digital_cardano addresses this gap by offering a native TLS solution that can be integrated with DAOs, ensuring that sensitive information such as votes, transactions, and governance decisions are transmitted securely across the network.

Additionally, it helps mitigate the security risks associated with unencrypted or insecure transmissions, which are especially crucial in financial systems like Cardano and other blockchain networks where integrity and confidentiality are paramount.



# Challenges I ran into
Cross-environment Compatibility: Ensuring the TLS implementation would work seamlessly across various platforms (browsers, Node.js, etc.) and maintain security standards was a complex challenge.

TLS Handshake Complexity: Implementing the TLS handshake process in a decentralized system was difficult due to the inherent differences in how DAOs manage user sessions and authentication.

Integration with Cardano: Adapting the TLS protocol to work with Cardanoâ€™s unique architecture and crypto functions required customizations that deviated from standard implementations.

Managing Cryptographic Keys: Securely handling and distributing cryptographic keys in a decentralized system posed additional risks and challenges, especially in terms of DAO node trust.



# Technologies I used
Node Forge: A powerful JavaScript library that provides implementations of TLS, cryptography, ciphers, and network protocols. It was the backbone for creating secure connections and encrypting communications in the DAO environment.

Browserify: Used to compile the code and bundle the cryptographic functions for browser environments.

Express: Leveraged for the backend server to facilitate secure communication between the DAO nodes.

Karma & Mocha: Testing tools to ensure the TLS implementation was secure and functional across multiple environments.

Node.js WebSocket: Enabled real-time secure communication using WebSockets for decentralized voting, decision-making, and governance processes.



# How we built it
We started by setting up the Node Forge library to provide the basic cryptographic functions like RSA, AES, and TLS. After that, we configured a secure communication channel using TLS for DAO transactions and governance activities. The cryptographic modules were bundled using Browserify to ensure compatibility in both browser-based and Node.js environments. Express was employed to manage backend services, and Karma and Mocha were used for rigorous unit testing to ensure our solution was secure.

The implementation was integrated into the DAO system with specific configurations to interact with the Cardano blockchain, providing secure communication for consensus and governance.
